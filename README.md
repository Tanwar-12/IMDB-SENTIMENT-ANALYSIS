The dataset that we are about to explore is called "IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset"; it is a supervised machine learning dataset that contains various movie reviews and it has a sentiment column which denotes whether the moview review is positive or negative. Our goal is to predict based on reviews from random person whether the review is positive or negative. For this project we will only be using basic classification models and some classification boosting techniques.
